```

### Cogs System

The bot uses Discord.py's cogs system to organize functionality into modular components:

- **Events Cogs**: Handle Discord events such as member joins, message events, and server updates
- **Slash Command Cogs**: Implement modern Discord slash commands for user interactions
- **Utility Functions**: Shared helper functions used across different cogs

### Database Collections

The bot maintains several MongoDB collections:
- `link`: Stores Discord-PESU account links
- `student`: Student linking data
- `anonban`: Anonymous messaging ban records
- `mute`: Server mute records

##  Configuration

The bot's behavior is controlled through several configuration files:

### `config.json`
Contains Discord server-specific configurations:
- Guild ID and role mappings
- Branch-specific role assignments
- Permission levels for different user types

### `faq.json`
Stores frequently asked questions and their responses for quick access.
